## Useful Kubernetes on Openstack Things

This repository aims to group various k8s resources and guides that I've found work on the Openstack deployment at the Sanger Institute. Included are a few pointers for things that I didn't find all that clear. 

This repository is currently under development.

 * [Deployment Using Kubespray](kubespray/)
 * [Setting Up LBaaS and Cinder](LBaaS-Cinder/)
 * [GlusterFS for RWM PV's](gluster/)
 * [Ingress controllers](ingress/)
 * [Helm and Tiller](helm/)
 * [Querying the Openstack API with httpie to keep your sanity.](api/)
